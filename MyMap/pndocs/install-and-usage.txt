1. About the module
===================
The MyMap module is a postnuke module that enables it to your users
to set up maps with markers, routes etc easily. Every user can
create own maps, insert markers into these maps or even create
"routes". To display routes you can also use an import function for
GPX gps data files.
The module can be applied as a hook in other modules. So your users
can easily insert cards in forum topics, weblog postings etc.

Features:
=========
- map management via user account panel
- marker management
- permission management for markers
- waypoints / routes management
- gpx import function for waypoints
- gps and kml export functions
- "content" plugin
- hook function to include the maps into any content
- on the fly map creation (great for module developers!)

2. Requirements and installation
===============
Please note that you have to fullfull a little list of requirements
to use this module:

2.1 Requirements
================
You must have:		- PostNuke > 0.80
					- PHP 5.x
					- fopen function enabled for your php scripts
					  (This is important for the usage of the
					  geonames.org webservice that is looked for
					  some geocoding)
You should have:	- gpsbabel (http://www.gpsbabel.org)
					  (Note that there are packages for most linux
					  distributions like debian etc.)
					- shell_exec php function enabled if you want
					  to use the waypoint simplifier "gpsbabel"
					  	  
2.2 Installation
================
Just copy the files into the modules folder, go to the admin panel
and install the module as every other module.

2.3 Hooks
=========
If you want to enable the insertion of maps into other modules
like pnForum, Weblog, News etc. please activate the MyMap hook
for these modules
If you want to include a map in a pnForum posting for example
just write ::mymap::5:: to display the map with the id "5".

3. Support for map providers
============================
All functions can be used with google as map provider. Using
other providers like openstreetmap, openlayers, map24 and so on
might cause some problems. If you have problems please report 
the problems (see 5. for details)!

4. Usage
========
Every user can create a new map
A map can be filled with markers. You can also use html in the
description (if you want to insert videos etc.) if your postnuke
installation ist configured to handle html code
Also waypoints can be added. If you have GPS data in GPX format
you can use an import function.
The management of waypoints is very easy. Clicking on the map
and the "add" button on the page adds a new waypoint.
The entered zoomfactor will only be used if there is just one
marker or waypoint linked with the map. If there are more markers
the map will automatically be set up the way that all markers are
visible.

5. Integrate maps in other modules
==================================
... is very easy! I just want to show an example - every dev
will understand the way he can integrade a map:

	$pnRender = pnRender::getInstance('legal');    
	// create map
	$coords[] = array(
    			'lat'	=> 48.922499263758255,
    			'lng'	=> 11.25
				);
    $coords[] = array(
    			'lat'	=> 42.922499263758255,
    			'lng'	=> 13.25,
    			'title'	=> 'testtitle',
    			'text'	=> 'and some <strong>content</strong> for this bubble',
				);
    $mapcode = pnModAPIFunc('MyMap','user','generateMap',array(
				'coords'	=> $coords,		// must be an array
				'maptype'	=> 'HYBRID',	// HYBRID, SATELLITE or NORMAL
				'width'		=> 640,			// width in pixels
				'height'	=> 480,			// height in pixels
				'zoomfactor' => 13			// zoomfactor - 1 is closest
				));							// zoomfactor only relevant if there is
											// only one marker displayed!
    $pnRender->assign('card_html_code',$mapcode);


The variable $card will have the generated HTML-text. You can
now assign this variable to your template and use the map where-
ever you need it!

6. Bugs and feature requests
============================
You have found an error or you are missing some functionallity
in the mymap module? Pleas use the NOC and the bug and feature
request tracker to report bugs or feature requests. Thank you

7. Saying thank you to the programmer
=====================================
If you like the module and if you can use it in your community
for example and you say to yourself that you want to give
something back to the autor of this module feel free to send
some paypal donation to florian.schiessl <at> ifs-net.de
Doing this supports the development of my postnuke modules.

Have a lot of fun with my modules!
