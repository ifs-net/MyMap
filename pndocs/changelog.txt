2008-08-17 by quan:
- removed hook api and hook functionality and:
- added needle support for MultiHook - it is simplier and 
  better than a hook!
  
2008-02-28 by trudero:
- Updated "mapstraction.js"
  Including fix to hide markers without removing tracks.
- Added asynchronous items download (AJAX/JSON)
  Currently disabled (commented) out because
  - download breaks if JSON exceedes ~4KB
    => sequentially downloading multiple parts
  - it is slower than the direcly integrated code


1.0
===
- initial release
